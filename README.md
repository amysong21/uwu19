College Squirrels

To win this game, you must keep your squirrel alive for ten rounds. 
Your squirrel starts at a health level of 80%. The thirst level is at 20% and the hunger level is at 20%. Your goal is to keep your health level above 0%, and your thirst level and hunger level below 100%. If those requirements are not met, then you lose the game and your squirrel has died. 

In each round, you have the option to do one of four things, each of which will affect the status of the squirrel.
The four options are below:

1. Feed the squirrel French fries - This will decrease the hunger level by 20% and the health level by 10%. It will increase the thirst level by 10%.
   
2. Feed the squirrel sprite - This will decrease the health level by 10% and the thirst level by 10%. 
   
3. Feed the squirrel acorns - This will increase the health level by 10% and the thirst level by 10%. This will decrease the hunger level by 10%.
