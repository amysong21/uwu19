College Squirrels

To win this game, you must keep your squirrel alive for ten rounds. 
Your squirrel starts at a health level of 100%. The thirst level is at 0% and the hunger level is at 0%. Your goal is to keep your health level above 0%, and your thirst level and hunger level below 100%. If those requirements are not met, then you lose the game and your squirrel has died.
